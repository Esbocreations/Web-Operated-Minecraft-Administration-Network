Web-Operated-Minecraft-Administration-Network
=============================================

A webbased control tool written in PHP.
It uses the Rcon function of the minecraft server to issue
commands out from the site onto the server.
Goal is to make a universal package with easy to expand for mods.

This uses the project https://github.com/xPaw/PHP-Minecraft-Query as connector and expands on it.
All rights of that project to the orginal developer!
